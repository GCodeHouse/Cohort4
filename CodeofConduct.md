# **G|CODE - Code of Conduct**

The G|Code community is committed to creating and sustaining a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion. We have a zero tolerance policy for all members of the G|Code community.

The G|Code community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The G|Code team will not act on complaints regarding:



* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ (because these things don’t exist).
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, ie “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts.
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial.
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

Reporting



* If you are being harassed by a member of the G|Code community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the G|Code team.
* If a G|Code team member or facilitator notices or is concerned about harassing behavior within sessions, they will be addressed immediately.

Consequences



* Any G|Code community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
* If a G|Code community member engages in harassing behavior, the G|Code team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all G|Code spaces.

The G|Code team has adopted this Code of Conduct and expects all G|Code community members to comply with all that is outlined in this Code of Conduct.
