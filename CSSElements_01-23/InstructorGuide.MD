## Strongly Recommended 
- Don't skip information on slides
- Frequently use the fist of 5 method to recognize if students are understanding the concepts on a scale of 0-5. 0 being not understanding at all. 5 being understood it completely
- Teach with patience and kindness
- We have a limited time to teach a lot of information, so we need to use our best judgement as to when to answer a question and when not to answer a question. If a question is off-topic, ask the student to add the question in slack, and a mentor will respond in a thread. If one student is having a specific issue following along that no one else is having, one of the assistant instructors will take them in a breakout room or a Google Meets to help them resolve the issue.
- Don't ask does anyone have any questions. Instead ask **what questions do you have?**
- Ping Rizel on Slack if you have any questions
- Try to be present at a session **BEFORE** you teach, so the students recognize your face AND so you have a better understanding of how we run the sessions.
- Join our Slack channel. Please email Rizel for the information on joining our slack channel


## Splitting teaching tasks
- Feel free to split the teaching however you and your co-instructor decide!
- What most of our instructors have done in the past is: one instructor does the slides, the second instructor does the code along.
