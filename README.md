**Projects:**

* Instructor guided tribute page
    * Code with me - Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript students will code along with the instructor of the day to learn and reinforce concepts discussed in class. Web page will serve as a tribute to a revolutionary woman of color in tech. 
* Group Tribute Page 
    * Students will work together in groups to develop tribute pages with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Personal Sites
    * Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript we will create personal pages that can be turned into portfolio sites or pages about a passion topic of their own!


## If you want to do group mentorship... 
- Join our Slack and the #facilitator-team-cohort-4 channel. (Message Rizel for Slack information) 
- Refer to our GitHub Repo to know what we will be teaching each session and to serve as a refresher on some topics. Check it out to see how we run the class and what the breakout room mentorship may look like.
- Keep an eye on the #cohort-4-winter-2022 channel. This is how we communicate with our students.
- On Sundays around 10:45 - 10:50 am EST, I'll post a Zoom link to our class sessions. Lectures may last until approximately 2:00 pm. After lectures, we will break into breakout rooms, and that's when we will need you! In the breakout rooms, there will be groups of 3-4 students working on a group project. I'll add you to a group and you will be a guide for the students if they have questions or need help.
- We have about 25 students, so we will need at least 6 mentors each session between 2pm -3pm. 
- There is no set schedule of when I'm expecting you to attend, but please try to attend as many sessions as you have the bandwidth for between 2pm - 3pm. You're welcome to join the class session before that as well, but you may be bored!
- Our first class on January 16 includes no classwork or coding, but it's nice to meet some of the Change Makers that day if you are available!
- If you have questions or concerns, email me at rizel@thegcodehouse.com

## If you want to host office hours...
- Join our Slack and the #facilitator-team-cohort-4 channel. (Message Rizel for Slack information) 
- Refer to our GitHub Repo to know what we will be teaching each session and to serve as a refresher on some topics. Check it out to see how we run the class and what the breakout room mentorship may look like.
- Keep an eye on the #cohort-4-winter-2022 channel. This is how we communicate with our students. 
- After each session, I will post a Slack poll asking which students need help and what times they are available to work with a mentor. I will ask you all (our facilitators, volunteers, mentors) if you all are available during the times our students indicated.
- If you are available, communicate with the students in our #cohort-4-winter-2022 channel, letting them know you can help them out. When the time comes closer, post a zoom or google meets link in the channel and let them know you're ready to help them debug the problem.
- If you have questions or concerns, email me at rizel@thegcodehouse.com.
