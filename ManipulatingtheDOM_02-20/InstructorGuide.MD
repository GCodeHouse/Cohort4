### How to Teach
Please take a look at some of our past classes to get a vibe for our teaching and mentorship style. I will definitely be there to help out, so don't feel like you're alone! Most people are paired with someone who has already taught at G{Code} in the past.

### Content that you will need
- Slides -- which can be found in this folder
- Code with me -- which can be found in this folder
- Both the slides and code with me are subject to change. If I get time to improve upon them!!! 

## Strongly Recommended 
- Don't skip information on slides
- Frequently use the fist of 5 method to recognize if students are understanding the concepts on a scale of 0-5. 0 being not understanding at all. 5 being understood it completely
- Teach with patience and kindness
- We have a limited time to teach a lot of information, so we need to use our best judgement as to when to answer a question and when not to answer a question. If a question is off-topic, ask the student to add the question in slack, and a mentor will respond in a thread. If one student is having a specific issue following along that no one else is having, one of the assistant instructors will take them in a breakout room or a Google Meets to help them resolve the issue.
- Don't ask does anyone have any questions. Instead ask **what questions do you have?**
- Ping Rizel on Slack if you have any questions
- Try to be present at a session **BEFORE** you teach, so the students recognize your face AND so you have a better understanding of how we run the sessions.
- Join our Slack channel. Please email Rizel for the information on joining our slack channel

## Code with Me Tips
- In our past cohorts, students really struggle with creating files and linking HTML, CSS, and JS files together. So, we need to be explicit with those steps for them. We need to do this each time that we do a code along to reduce issues. 
- Before you do the code with me, send them the link to the github repo. 
- Show yourself creating a new folder on an easy place to access like your Desktop. You can call it GCode_Day[insert number]_[topic that your teaching]
- Create a new file called index.html inside of that folder
- Show yourself copying and pasting the contents from the index.html on GitHub
- Create a new file called for the css 
- Show yourself copying and pasting the contents from the css stylesheet on GitHub
- Check to see if the class is following along


## Splitting teaching tasks
- Feel free to split the teaching however you and your co-instructor decide!
- What most of our instructors have done in the past is: one instructor does the slides, the second instructor does the code along.
