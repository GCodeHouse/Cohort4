// people use console logs to help them check if their javascript is working
// console logs print out in the console of your browser
// lets check to see if the words hello world appear in a browser
// if it does, that means our javascript is connected to our html

console.log('hello world')

// lets try to get the body element by its id

document.getElementById('mainBackground')
                        
// althought that syntax is right, we don't know if it worked,
// so let's console log it to see that it grabbed the right element 

console.log(document.getElementById('mainBackground'))
